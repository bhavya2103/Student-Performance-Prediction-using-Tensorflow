# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Tensorflow

Supervised learning algorithm (Linear Regression ) was used to predict the student performance from different features like traveltime, studytime, failures, absences etc. 

The mean absolute error achieved was 0.644 and the mean squared error was 0.644
